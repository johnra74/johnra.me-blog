					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s been a while since I posted an entry &#8211; just go ahead and look at the date on my prior post. I don&#8217;t even know if blogging is a thing anymore in the world of TikTok. Granted, given how vastness and complex technology space is, I don&#8217;t think anyone can do justice on a short video. Look, it&#8217;s not like this is my New Year&#8217;s resolution or anything like that. Let&#8217;s see if I can try to post at least once a month. And yes, I get credit for this post towards January.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a prevailing view that you&#8217;re not a real tech geek unless you have your own blog. I disagree. But then, it looks very much like I&#8217;ve succumbed to peer pressure. I prefer to think I was a rebel by going against the grain all along. That said, like every new programming language I&#8217;ve written, here&#8217;s to my first blog, &#8220;Hello World!&#8221;]]></description>
