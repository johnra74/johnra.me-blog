<p>Unless you&#8217;ve abstained from social networks, you&#8217;re probably heard of <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> or have seen blocks of green, black, and yellow on your social feed. I have to admit, I&#8217;ve been caught up on the riptide &#8211; even google has acknowledged the popularity of it </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="345" height="151" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/google-wordle.png" alt="" class="wp-image-539"/></figure></div>



<p>I tend to stay away from mainstream fad &#8211; especially those on social media platforms. I did, however, read the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">article on New York Times</a> &#8211; who later <a href="https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/the-creator-of-wordle-just-sold-it-for-seven-figures-taught-5-smart-lessons-in-process.html">purchased it for 7-figures</a>. Eventually, I gave in and played to see what the craze was about. To my surprise, I was instantly hooked. I was surprised by the simplicity of it. I&#8217;ve written 2 mobile games that I published on both Apple App Store and Android Play Store &#8211; both failed to retain players. My games were too monotonous and lacked meaningful engagement to maintain revisit. I never considered the &#8220;less is more&#8221; approach. The simple idea of releasing one puzzle a day is genius.</p>



<p>This brings me to the title, &#8220;7-Minute Abs.&#8221; An old colleague mentioned it when I shared <a href="https://www.wordhex.app/">WordHex</a>, an app I created over the weekend.  &#8220;7-Minute Abs&#8221; is a <a href="https://youtu.be/rnso4nfdM9w">scene from &#8220;Something About Mary&#8221;</a> where the hitchhiker shares his business idea based on &#8220;8-Minute Abs&#8221; but in 7 minutes! It&#8217;s a little spot on.</p>



<p>I created WordHex based on Wordle except it&#8217;s 6-letter words. One puzzle a day was just not enough for me. I wanted to play another round. I also hadn&#8217;t coded in a while. Last time I did, it was in golang &#8211; I may share the back story on that in the future. WordHex is available in beta. Once it&#8217;s stable, a friend suggested I create one for 4-letter, 7-letter, and 8-letter words as well. </p>



<p>If you do find Wordle entertaining and, like me, can&#8217;t wait another day; please visit <a href="https://www.wordhex.app/">WordHex</a>. </p>
